# Project 1: Historical Substitution Ciphers
## Task 1
The first goal of this task was to write a function that takes in two strings and encrypts the first string with the second string using the Vigenere cipher.
The second goal of this task was to write a complementary decryption function for the Vigenere encryption function.

---
## Task 2
The goal of this task was to create a function that would take in a ciphertext generated by the Vigenere cipher, a substring of the corresponding plaintext, and a maximum key size and brute-force test different key values until a plaintext containing the substring was generated.
